# catbuffer

This is the Python version of the catbuffer library. It is generated using [catbuffer-generators](https://github.com/symbol/catbuffer-generators) from the [catbuffer](https://github.com/symbol/catbuffer-schemas) specification.

The generated code is in Python version 3.7.

This library helps serialize and deserialize NEM's Catapult entities in Python applications.

The library's main client is (symbol-sdk-core-python). We suggest not using this library directly.

Right now only transactions and related objects are generated in a sensible manner, support for state-related objects will be added in future.
